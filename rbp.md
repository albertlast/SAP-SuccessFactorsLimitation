## no dencentralzation

In an abap system it's possible to probagate part of the work to different unites,
which a limit in the given space which authorazation can be changed or assigned.
Sutch options are not feasible in rbp,
when you are able to change roles, you can change all the roles,
same for thie assign process which can only be you can assign any one or no one.

The result of this limitation is that you need a central department to management this,
which leads in more time consuming and more men power.
